## Project Title: `Result Management System`

### Introduction:
A Result Management System (RMS) is a web-based application through which the results of students studying in an educational institution can be created and managed. A system that is automated is used to computerize this data. Here, computerization is more advantageous than the typical procedure. Thus, an educational institution can profit greatly from a result management system in many ways. Teachers can readily modify and access student data to comply with state regulations and other legal requirements.
The key goal of this project is to create and automate a computer system to manage and publish student results. This application also provides facilities like adding, maintaining, and publishing the students and their results. Here only the authorized person (like a teacher) can add students, add their results, and publish them. On the other hand, a student can enter the application with his required log-in credentials, view his results, and download the required documents in PDF format.
